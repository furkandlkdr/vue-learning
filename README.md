# "Develop with VueJS" Course

I'm learning Vue.js by now and this repo is made with [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/) + my additional comments.

You can access the notes I wrote in Turkish on the Notion page at this [link](https://nafair.notion.site/Udemy-Vue-1a3cfaa680e4456aa90a5481a5857a9c).
